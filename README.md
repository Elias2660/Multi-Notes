# Multi Notes Project

This project contains various markdown files for different test preparations in a multi-variable calculus course. Each test preparation document focuses on specific topics, such as:

• Equations of lines, planes, cylinders, and spheres  
• Vectors, dot products, and cross products  
• Determinants, partial derivatives, and directional derivatives  
• Gradients and Taylor polynomials  
• Critical points, second derivative test, and optimization  

Use these notes to review key ideas, formulas, and practice problems before exams. They can also use this link ([GitHub Markdown Printer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/github-markdown-printer/fehpdlpmcegfpbkgcnaleindodeegapk?hl=en)) to print out the markdown files.
